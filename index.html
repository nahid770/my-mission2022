    <h1>My Roadmap of 2022</h1>
    <p>I Have made a plan for my goal and a roadmap.The road map is the best solution for what you need to learn first and last and how to apply that and when apply that. Firstly I will learn HTML after that CSS and when i complete html css i have to create some sample websites. Then Bootstrap. After complete bootstrap i will go for javascript then react and always after completing a language or in the learining time i will try to make some websites for practice and this is my roadmap for the mission.</p>
